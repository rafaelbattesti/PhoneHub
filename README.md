# PhoneHub #

This is a Single Page Application (SPA) mobile ready e-commerce prototype.
This project was created as the final project for Sheridan College's Mobile Web-based Application Development.

For the sake of educational purposes, no scafolding has been used.

### What is this repository for? ###

* PhoneHub SPA
* 0.1
* [JQuery Mobile](https://jquerymobile.com/)
* [LinkedIn Profile](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/rafaelbattesti)

### Important Notes ###

* This project uses images and JSON files from the [angular-phonecat](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat) open source project.
* The purpose of using those resources is to focus on the development of the SPA itself instead of the content of the application.

### What technology does it use? ###
* Front-end: AJAX, JQuery and JQuery Mobile.
* Back-end: Still not implemented

### How do I get set up? ###

* This is a front-end project, thus requiring a simple http server to serve html and JSON files.
* All the dependencies have been added to version control (not a good practice, I know!) but for the sake of having a complete source of knowledge in the remote repository.
* No tests have been deployed for this application (so far...)

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Implement unit tests - verify available technology.
* Sugestions on continuous integration.
* Code review is always welcome.

### Who do I talk to? ###

* <me@rafaelbattesti.com>

Thanks for reading over. This is a prototype.
