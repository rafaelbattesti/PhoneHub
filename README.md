# PhoneHub #

This is a Single Page Application (SPA) mobile ready e-commerce prototype.
This project was created as the final project for Sheridan College's Mobile Web-based Application Development.

For the sake of educational purposes, no scafolding has been used.

### What is this repository for? ###

* PhoneHub SPA
* 0.1
* [JQuery Mobile](https://jquerymobile.com/)
* [JQuery Theme Roller](http://themeroller.jquerymobile.com/)
* [LinkedIn Profile](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/rafaelbattesti)

### What technology does it use? ###
* Front-end: AJAX, JQuery, JQuery Mobile and JQuery Theme Roller CSS.
* Back-end: PHP and MySQL

### How do I get set up? ###

* This project requires a LAMP Server to host the files.
* Clone this repo in document root (htdocs) of your apache webserver to make them available through port 80 of your localhost or webserver.
* All the dependencies have been added to version control (not a good practice, I know!) but for the sake of having a complete source of knowledge in the remote repository.
* No tests have been deployed for this application (so far...)

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Implement unit tests - verify available technology.
* Sugestions on continuous integration.
* Code review is always welcome.

### Who do I talk to? ###
